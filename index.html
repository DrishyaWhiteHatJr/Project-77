        <h1>Project on Console</h1>
        <h3>Write about Visual Code and How to Set it Up?</h3>
        <p>Visual Code is a platform for creating websites. This platform is a more advanced way for coders to live view their work and code offline. Similar to Brackets it uses folders on your computer to store ur code and html. You just use any internet browser such as chrome or firefox and dowload it from the website. First getting the setup application, then the actual platform. To store your work create a folder and then open that folder in VS code, now every thing will be stored in here!For different projects create different folders. </p>
        <h3>Write about the Console Screen, why it is used, how to open it and how to enter something into console screen.</h3>
        <p>The Console Screen has Many Uses, like debugging your code when somethings wrong, which believe me saves a lot of time. To open the console screen, right click on your screen and click inspect. On the top bar you should see "console" clicking on that will allow you to open the console screen. To enter something into the console screen is very easy. After connected your js to html using "script" open the js file. Then type in console.log() and here you go anything you want to type in to the console log type into the brackets.</p>
